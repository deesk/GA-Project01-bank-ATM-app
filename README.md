# GA Bank ATM App
Git-Website: https://deesk.github.io/GA-Project01-banking-ATM-app/



This is my first project during WDI course in GA. Details are as follows,
- GA-Project01: GA Bank ATM App
- Deadline: 9th Feb '17
- Course timeline: Week 2nd of 12th

### Specification:
* Keeping track of the checking and savings balances somewhere
* Adding functionality so that a user can deposit money into one of the bank accounts.
* Updating the display and manipulating the HTML of the page
so a user can see the change.
* Add functionality so that a user can withdraw money from one of the bank accounts.
* Making sure balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to
withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
* When the balance of the bank account is $0 the background of that bank account
should change color from gray to red.
* Backgournd color of account is gray when there is money in the account
* These accounts have overdraft protection both ways, so if a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the checking balance down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the savings account.
* If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignores it.

### Demonstration:
- JavaScript functions
- Manipulating the DOM.
- building out the logic using JavaScript

### Future improvments
- Making code more DRYer
